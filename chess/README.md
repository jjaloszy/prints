# Chess Set
This is a chess set.  
The pawn was manually created.
The other pieces were created with a FreeCAD python script.

# Running macros to generate chess pieces
These macros can be run from the command line with:
freecad <piece>.FCMacro

FreeCAD can take a while to execute the macros, possibly several minutes.
